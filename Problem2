Problem 2:


Here's what the code is trying to do in simpler terms:
Imagine you have a list of tasks that you want to do, and you want to get them done quickly. This code creates a way to do those tasks simultaneously.
* 		It sets up a system for handling these tasks using something called a "channel," which is like a conveyor belt for tasks. The channel can hold up to 10 tasks at a time.
* 		It hires four workers (we call them goroutines) to help with the tasks. Each worker sits by the conveyor belt (the channel) and takes tasks as they come.
* 		The main boss (the main function) decides to send a particular task to the conveyor belt. In this case, the task is to print the word "HERE1."
* 		As soon as the boss sends the task, it doesn't wait around. It goes ahead and says "Hello" (prints "Hello").
* 		Meanwhile, the worker goroutines are always ready. When they see a task on the conveyor belt, they grab it and do it. In this case, they see the task "HERE1" and print it.
In simpler terms, this code helps you get things done faster by getting a group of workers (goroutines) to work on tasks at the same time. It uses a conveyor belt (channel) to pass the tasks to the workers. It's like a team effort to be more efficient.
This pattern can be used in various situations where you have lots of tasks, and you want to get them done quickly and efficiently. For example, think of a kitchen with multiple chefs cooking different dishes at the same time, or a factory with workers assembling products on an assembly line. It's all about teamwork and efficiency!
